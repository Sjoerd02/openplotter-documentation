We recommend the popular [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) because it fits the requeriments: low-cost, low-consumption and has a huge community of developers.

**OpenPlotter RPI**,  the operative system for Raspberry Pi and OpenPlotter is ready!

##Box

There are a lot of models to protect the Raspberry Pi board. 
We are working in a water resistant enclosure.
##Power supply

The Pi is powered by a 5V USB power supply with a micro USB connector (like most standard mobile phone chargers). Exactly how much current (mA) the Raspberry Pi requires is dependent on what you connect to it. The maximum power the Raspberry Pi can use is 1 Amp. If you need to connect a USB device that will take the power requirements above 1 Amp, then you must connect it to an externally-powered USB HUB.
