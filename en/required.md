##Keyboard and mouse

Any standard USB keyboard and mouse will work with your Raspberry Pi. Wireless keyboards and mice will work if already paired.

##SD card

The Raspberry Pi 2 should work with any micro-SD-compatible cards, although there are some guidelines that should be followed:

####SD card size (capacity) 

A minimum of 4GB is required but 8GB is recommended.

####SD card class

The card class determines the sustained write speed for the card; a class 4 card will be able to write at 4MB/s, whereas a class 10 should be able to attain 10 MB/s. However it should be noted that this does not mean a class 10 card will outperform a class 4 card for general usage, because often this write speed is achieved at the cost of read speed and increased seek times.

####Buy a SD card with OpenPlotter RPI pre-installed
8GB class 10 microSD card (with a full-size SD adaptor) that outperforms almost all other SD cards on the market.
