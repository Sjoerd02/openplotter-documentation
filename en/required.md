##ARM embedded computer
![](rpi2.jpg)

We recommend the popular [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) because it fits the requeriments: low-cost, low-consumption and has a huge community of developers.

**OpenPlotter RPI**,  the operative system for Raspberry Pi and OpenPlotter is ready!

##Box

There are a lot of models to protect the Raspberry Pi board. 
We are working in a water resistant enclosure.

##Power supply and cable

The Pi is powered by a 5V USB power supply with a micro USB connector (like most standard mobile phone chargers). Exactly how much current (mA) the Raspberry Pi requires is dependent on what you connect to it. The maximum power the Raspberry Pi can use is 1 Amp. If you need to connect a USB device that will take the power requirements above 1 Amp, then you must connect it to an externally-powered USB HUB.

It would be a good idea to get an USB car charger adapter (12v to 5V, 3.1A) with two outputs in case you need to power an USB HUB too.

##HDMI/DVI/VGA/TV monitor and cable

The Raspberry Pi has a HDMI port which you can plug directly into a monitor or TV with an HDMI cable. This is the easiest solution; some modern monitors and TVs have HDMI ports, and some do not, but there are other options:

**DVI**

For monitors with a DVI port, you can use an HDMI-to-DVI cable.

**VGA**

For monitors with VGA only, you can use an HDMI-to-VGA adapter. We suggest using only powered HDMI-to-VGA adapters (with an external power source).

**Composite Port**

For analogue TVs you can use  a 3.5mm composite video/audio lead.

##Keyboard and mouse

Any standard USB keyboard and mouse will work with your Raspberry Pi. Wireless keyboards and mice will work if already paired.

##SD card

The Raspberry Pi 2 should work with any micro-SD-compatible cards, although there are some guidelines that should be followed:

**SD card size (capacity)**. A minimum of 4GB is required but 8GB is recommended.

**SD card class**. The card class determines the sustained write speed for the card; a class 4 card will be able to write at 4MB/s, whereas a class 10 should be able to attain 10 MB/s. However it should be noted that this does not mean a class 10 card will outperform a class 4 card for general usage, because often this write speed is achieved at the cost of read speed and increased seek times.
