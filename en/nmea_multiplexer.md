It is important that you understand that OpenPlotter must drive all the NMEA data traffic to work properly, so you do not need to configure OpenCPN to get GPS signal, we will set this in OpenPlotter NMEA 0183 tab.

## System defaults

All the data generated by OpenPlotter (sensors, SDR AIS, calculations ...) will be automatically sent to the ***system input*** (type UDP, address 127.0.0.1 and port 10110).

All the inputs will be automatically merged (multiplexed) and will be available at the ***system output*** (type TCP, address 127.0.0.1 and port 10110). You have just to create a TCP network input in OpenCPN to listen to address 127.0.0.1 and port 10110 to get all the NMEA data.

You can not disable nor delete *system input* and *system output*.

If you want to connect a GPS USB dongle or a NMEA 0183 to USB converter, you will have to create a serial input in the NMEA 0183 Multiplexer.
