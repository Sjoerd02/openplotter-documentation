It is important that you understand that OpenPlotter must drive all the data traffic to work properly, so you do not need to configure OpenCPN to get GPS signal, we will set this in OpenPlotter.

If you want to connect a GPS USB dongle or a NMEA 0183 to USB converter, you will have to create a serial input in the [NMEA 0183 Multiplexer](nmea_multiplexer..md).

## System defaults

All the data generated by OpenPlotter ([Sensors](sensors.md), [SDR AIS](sdr_ais.md), [Calculations](calculate.md)...) will be automatically sent to *system input* (UDP localhost 10110) in the NMEA 0183 Multiplexer.

All the inputs will be automatically multiplexed and available at the *system output* (TCP localhost 10110). You have just to configure OpenCPN to listen to *system output* (TCP localhost 10110) to get all the data.

## Ok, now what?

Congratulations! You have your system running so it is time to start getting some data from the world. The most common and logic step it would be connecting a GPS.
