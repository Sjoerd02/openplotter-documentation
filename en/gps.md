# Connecting a GPS

It is important that you understand that OpenPlotter must drive all the data traffic to work properly, so you do not need to configure OpenCPN to get GPS signal, we will set this in OpenPlotter.

If you want to connect a GPS USB dongle or a NMEA 0183 to USB converter, you will have to create a serial input in the [NMEA 0183 Multiplexer](nmea_multiplexer..md).
