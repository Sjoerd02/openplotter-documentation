# Getting started


First of all you have to put together all the [basic parts](required.md). If you have trouble with some aspect, try to find help on the [Raspberry Pi official page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/).

Second you have to run the software on your new ARM computer. We use **OpenPlotter RPI** which is a modified version of [Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org/), the official operating system for the Raspberry Pi.

Follow this detailed guide to download and install OpenPlotter RPI:

or buy our plug and play SD card with OpenPlotter RPI ready to run:

## Ok, now what?

Congratulations! You have your system running so it is time to start getting some data from the world. The most common and logic step it would be connecting a GPS.

It is important that you understand that OpenPlotter must drive all the data traffic to work properly, so you do not need to configure OpenCPN to get GPS signal, we will set this in OpenPlotter.

If you want to connect a GPS USB dongle or a NMEA 0183 to USB converter, you will have to create a serial input in the [NMEA 0183 Multiplexer](nmea_multiplexer..md).

You can create network inputs as well.

All the data generated by OpenPlotter ([Sensors](sensors.md), [SDR AIS](sdr_ais.md), [Calculations](calculate.md)...) will be automatically sent to *system input* (UDP localhost 10110) in the NMEA 0183 Multiplexer.

All the inputs will be automatically multiplexed and available at the *system output* (TCP localhost 10110). You have just to configure OpenCPN to listen to *system output* (TCP localhost 10110) to get all the data.
