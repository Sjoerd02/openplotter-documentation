First of all you have to put together all the [basic parts](getting_started.md). If you have trouble with some aspect, try to find help on the [Raspberry Pi official page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/).

Second you have to run the software on your new ARM computer. We use **OpenPlotter RPI** which is a modified version of [Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org/), the official operating system for the Raspberry Pi.

Follow this detailed guide to download and install OpenPlotter RPI:
