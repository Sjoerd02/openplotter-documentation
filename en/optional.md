##Self powered USB Hub

If you are connecting devices which use more power than your Raspberry can manage, you will need a self powered USB Hub.

It would be a good idea to get a Hub with 5V input so that you could power it with the same source as your raspberry.

##USB WiFi dongle

You will need an USB WiFi dongle if you want to connect either OpenPlotter to internet or your devices on board to OpenPlotter.

A WiFi adapter will probably need more power than the Raspberry Pi USB port can provide, especially if there is a large distance from the WiFi adapter to the WiFi Access Point, or it is transferring large amounts of data. Therefore, you may need to plug the WiFi adapter into a powered USB hub.

###WiFi access point

To share data with devices on board you have to set OpenPlotter as access point and connect devices to it. However not all WiFi dongles can function as an access point, only devices with the **RTL8192CU** or **RTL8188CUS** chipset will work.

##USB GPS dongle

If you don't have any GPS on board or you want an extra positioning device, this is the cheapest way.

Connecting an USB GPS dongle to OpenPlotter it will provide accurate position, date/time and speed/course over ground.

###Buy a tested GPS/GLONASS USB dongle.

##USB RS422/RS232 converter dongle

If you have sensors and electronics with NMEA-0183 outputs on board you will need an USB converter to connect it to OpenPlotter.

The NMEA-0183 hardware standard uses RS422 connectors but you may find some devices with RS232 as well. 

###Buy a tested USB RS422/RS232 converter.

Select your right connector.
