##Self powered USB Hub

If you are connecting devices which use more power than your Raspberry can manage, you will need a self powered USB Hub.

It would be a good idea to get a Hub with 5V input so that you could power it with the same source as your raspberry.

##USB WiFi dongle

If you want to connect to internet or configure OpenPlotter as an access point, you will need an USB WiFi dongle.

A WiFi adapter will probably need more power than the Raspberry Pi USB port can provide, especially if there is a large distance from the WiFi adapter to the WiFi Access Point, or it is transferring large amounts of data. Therefore, you may need to plug the WiFi adapter into a powered USB hub.

**Access point**

To share data with devices on board you have to set OpenPlotter as access point and connect devices to it. However not all WiFi dongles can function as an access point, only devices with the **RTL8192CU** or **RTL8188CUS** chipset will work.
