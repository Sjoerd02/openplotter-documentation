# NMEA 0183 to USB converter

![](rs422.png)

If you have electronics with NMEA 0183 outputs on board (depth, wind, heading...), you will need an USB converter to connect it to OpenPlotter. Additionally, if this converter is bi-directional, you will be able to talk to electronics with NMEA 0183 inputs like the autopilot.

The NMEA 0183 hardware standard uses **RS422** connectors but you may find some devices with **RS232** as well. Find out about what type of connection you need.

## Settings

See [NMEA 0183](/nmea-0183-multiplexer.md) chapter to configure NMEA 0183 to USB converters.
