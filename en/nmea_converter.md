# NMEA 0183 to USB converter

![](rs422.png)

If you have electronics with NMEA 0183 outputs on board (depth, wind, heading...) you will need an USB converter to connect it to OpenPlotter. Additionally, you will be able to talk to electronics with NMEA 0183 inputs (autopilot).

The NMEA 0183 hardware standard uses RS422 connectors but you may find some devices with RS232 as well. 

####Buy a tested USB NMEA 0183 bi-directional converter.

Select your right connector.
