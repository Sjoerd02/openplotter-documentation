Q: Can I create my own SignalK names?

A: You can but it is recommended that you don't (to develop more standard names look for specifications in Github SignalK). If you want to have an overview of already existing SignalK names open the _diagnostic SignalK input_ window and click on _Unit Setting_. If there is a star in the SignalK name you should put in an easy understandable name.
