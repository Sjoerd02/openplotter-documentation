# Self powered USB Hub

![](hub.png)

If you are connecting devices which use more power than your Raspberry can provide, you will need a self powered USB Hub.

You can start connecting devices to the raspberry and switch to a self powered hub when you start to see strange behavior of the devices.

It would be a good idea to get a Hub with 5V input so that you could power it with the same source as your raspberry.
