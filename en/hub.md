# Self powered USB Hub

![](hub.png)

If you are connecting devices which use more power than your Raspberry can provide, you will need a self powered USB Hub.

You can start connecting devices to the raspberry and switch to a self powered hub when you start to see strange behavior of the devices.

Hubs with **FE1.1S** chip work right, avoid hubs with MA8601 chip. Often the same model can contain any of them. And some of them do not contain chips at all! just a glob of black material to hide what is underneath ... nothing.

It would be a good idea to get a Hub with 5V input so that you could power it with the same source as your raspberry.
