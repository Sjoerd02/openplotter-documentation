# Pressure/temperature sensor

![](bmp180.png)

Connecting a pressure sensor to OpenPlotter will provide air pressure data to build graphs and monitor weather.

Often, pressure and temperature sensors are on the same board.

If you have another board like an humidity sensor wchich has a temperature sesnsor too, you will be able to select wcich one you prefer.

Pressure/temperature sensors have to be connected by I2C interface.
