# Pressure/Temperature sensor

![](bmp180.png)

Connecting a pressure sensor to OpenPlotter will provide air pressure data to build graphs and monitor weather.

Often, pressure and temperature sensors are on the same board.

If you have another board like an humidity sensor which has a temperature sensor too, you will be able to select which one you prefer.

Pressure/Temperature sensors have to be connected by I2C interface.

##Supported pressure/temperature sensors
