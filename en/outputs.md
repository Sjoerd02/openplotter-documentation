## General
Outputs are driven through the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins. These pins are copper connected to the CPU chip. A short circuit with 0V or +3.3V is not final, but any direct contact with the + 5v (or higher) can KILL the Raspberry Pi... 
The output have to be activated in OpenPlotter related panel.
