# DS18B20 temperature sensors

## Wiring

You have to connect these sensors to **GPIO4**, **GND** and **3.3V** pins. Use a pull-up resistor as shown in the image below. You can connect multiple sensors in paralel using just one resistor.

If you want to change the GPIO pin, edit the file config.txt typing in a terminal:

```sudo nano /boot/config.txt```

At the end of the file you should see a line like this

*dtoverlay=w1-gpio*

replace it by

*dtoverlay=w1-gpio,gpiopin=x*

where x is your desired GPIO pin. Save and reset.
