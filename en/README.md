What is OpenPlotter?
=======

OpenPlotter is a combination of software and hardware to be used as navigational aid on small and medium boats. It works on ARM computers like the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and is open-source, low-cost and low-consumption. Its design is modular, so you just have to implement what your boat needs. Do it yourself.
