# Documentation

We have a Github repository[[1]](https://github.com/sailoog/openplotter-documentation) for OpenPlotter documentation. This repository is connected to a Gitbook book[[2]](https://www.gitbook.com/book/sailoog/openplotter-documentation/details) and we coordinate editors in a forum[[3]](http://forum.openmarine.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=16) on OpenMarine.

if you want to help us to write, update, correct or translate you have two options.

You are familiar with Github and Gitbook repositories edition:

* Create an account in **Github**[[4]](https://github.com/join)
* Send your Github account user name to the forum[[3]](http://forum.openmarine.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=16) and wait for you to be granted permissions to edit the repository.
* From the sticky threads in the forum[[3]](http://forum.openmarine.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=16), select a chapter marked in blue and notify your intentions in a new thread.
* Once you have permissions, login to **Gitbook**[[5]](https://www.gitbook.com/login) with your Github account.
* Go to the book[[2]](https://www.gitbook.com/book/sailoog/openplotter-documentation/details) and click on the _Edit_ button upper right.

You are not familiar with Github and Gitbook repositories edition:

* From the sticky threads in the forum[[3]](http://forum.openmarine.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=16), select a chapter marked in blue and notify your intentions in a new thread.
* When you are done, publish text and images into a new thread in the forum[[3]](http://forum.openmarine.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=16) and someone will edit the book for you.

## Writing

We write the documentation source in English to make easier translating to other languages. 

Please do not modify the index or the structure without consulting developers. Once a chapter is done, please notify on the forum[[3]](http://forum.openmarine.net/forumdisplay.php?fid=16) to be marked in green.

To include images in the rest of languages from English folder, the path is `../en/xxx.png`

If you want to add images of wiring and connections consider using fritzing[[6]](http://fritzing.org) application.

Do not modify or translate files names \(xxx.md xxx.png xxx.jpg ...\) because they are referenced in the text.
