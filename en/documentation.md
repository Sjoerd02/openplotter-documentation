## Writing

We write the documentation source in English to make easier translating to other languages. If you want to
write a chapter, notify to info@sailoog.com to coordinate. Please do not modify the index without notify to
info@sailoog.com. Once the new chapter is done in English, please copy the new text and images to the rest
of languages to be ready to translate. If you are not creating a new chapter but editing an existing one,
include a note at the beginning of the rest of languages “This translation needs to be updated”.
If you want to add images of wiring and connections consider using fritzing application. http://fritzing.org
