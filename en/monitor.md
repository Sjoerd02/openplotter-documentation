The Raspberry Pi has a HDMI port which you can plug directly into a monitor or TV with an HDMI cable.

The minimum size to use conveniently OpenPlotter is 7 inches (800x480px).

Actually this is not essential, you can use OpenPlotter from your laptop, tablet or phone by remote desktop. See chapter [Headless](headless.md).
