# Diagnostics

On NMEA 0183 tab is the buttom diagnostic.

Select a line and click the buttom.

One or two windows pop up \(two if setting is "both"\).

They show the transfered sentences

On the lower left side you can see the calculated transfer speed in baud.

! If the output speed is higher than the baudrate of the device some data will be cut. Select filters to send only needed data!
