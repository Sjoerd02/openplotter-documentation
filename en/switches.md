Switches are driven through the GPIO \(General Purpose Input/Output\) pins. These pins are copper connected to the CPU chip. A short circuit with 0V or +3.3V is not final, but any direct contact with the + 5v \(or higher\) can KILL the Raspberry Pi... Switches have to be activated in OpenPlotter related tab.
