# Switches

This chapter is under construction

Switches are driven through the GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins. These pins are copper connected to the CPU chip. A short circuit with 0V or +3.3V is not final, but any direct contact with the + 5v (or higher) can KILL the Raspberry Pi... Switches have to be activated in OpenPlotter related tab. 

Pins numbers are according to the diagram below where, for example, pin GPIO22 is pin position number 15.
