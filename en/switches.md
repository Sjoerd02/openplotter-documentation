# Wiring Switches

This chapter is under construction

Switches are driven through the GPIO \(General Purpose Input/Output\) pins. These pins are copper connected to the CPU chip. A short circuit with 0 V or +3.3 V is not final, but any direct contact with the + 5 V \(or higher\) can KILL the Raspberry Pi... Switches have to be activated in OpenPlotter related tab.
