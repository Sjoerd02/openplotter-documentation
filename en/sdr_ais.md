# DVB-T dongle (AIS)


DVB-T dongles based on the Realtek RTL2832U chip and the new R820T2 tuner can work as a SDR AIS receiver. OpenPlotter is ready to get SDR AIS signal out of the box, you just have to calibrate.

A DVB-T dongle will need more power than the Raspberry Pi USB port can provide. You need to plug the dongle into a powered USB hub.

You can buy our DVB-T dongle and we can calibrate it for you and include a note with the correction value (ppm):

## Antenna

Although you can get to receive some boat with the supplied mini antenna, it is not enough for optimal reception of AIS frequencies. Any VHF antenna with the appropriate connector adapter will work fine. The antenna connector type of the dongle is female MCX.

Some home-made antennas:
