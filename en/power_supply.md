# Power supply and cable

The Raspberry Pi is powered by a 5V USB power supply with a micro USB connector (like most standard mobile phone chargers). Exactly how much current (mA) the Raspberry Pi requires is dependent on what you connect to it. The maximum power the Raspberry Pi can use is 1 Amp. If you need to connect a USB device that will take the power requirements above 1 Amp, then you must connect it to an externally-powered USB Hub.

It would be a good idea to get an USB car charger adapter (12v to 5V, 3.1A) with two outputs in case you need to power an USB Hub too.
