# Ordenador integrado ARM

![](../en/rpi2.jpg)

Recomendamos la conocida [Raspberry Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) porque satisface los requisitos de: open-source, asequible, bajo cons y cuenta con unaenorme comund desarrolladores.

We are developing **OpenPlotter RPI**, a special operating system for Raspberry Pi based on Linux Raspbian distribution. When development is done we will migrate to other ARM boards.

You can use OpenPlotter with Raspberry Pi [model Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/) and [model 1](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/) but they have poor performance running OpenCPN. These models are perfect for headless systems.
